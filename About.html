                <p>Most farmers in the Nadowli-Kaleo District, especially women, are peasant farmers who are economically vulnerable and rely heavily on the land for their livelihood. Hence, there is an urgent need to equip these peasant farmers with the knowledge and skills of sustainable farming practices to combat the current trend of climate change which is posing a threat of food insecurity in the district. Disong EcoFarmers Network Ghana (DEN-GH) is a non-governmental organisation (NGO) established in Kaleo, in the Upper West Region of Ghana, with the focus on climate change adaptation by promoting sustainable agriculture and environmental stewardship in the Nadowli-Kaleo District to support farmers. Founded in the year 2023, the organisation is empowering local farmers through education and support aimed at adopting sustainable farming practices and protecting the environment.
